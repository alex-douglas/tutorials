    "# The Goal: read a .sav file into Python and interpret\n",
    "SPSS files, using .sav as their extension, work great if you have the SPSS software. However, that software costs money. So how can we read in the data using Python? Unfortunately .sav files have lots of metadata associated with them, so it's not as simple as converting to .csv and boom you're done. Many cell values are numbers mapped to a specific value (i.e. a `Language` column might have `1` for `English` and `2` for `Spanish`), but you don't know this without reading the metadata. So how can we analyze these .sav files?"
