# Reading a .sav File

The Jupyter notebook contained in this folder goes through the process of reading a .sav file and associated metadata into Python and specifically a Pandas dataframe. See my blog post on the subject [here](http://alexrdouglas.com/posts/read_sav_file.html). Data files used in the notebook are also saved here.

The notebook itself does a pretty good job of going through the process, so Iâ€™d start there before the blog post.
