# Tutorial: Regression in Stata and Python

This tutorial goes through a similar regression process as that done by Gin√© and Mansuri in their work on the voting behavior of rural Pakistani women (see [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20130480) for the homepage of the research paper).

Please see my blog post [here](http://alexrdouglas.com/tutorial-regression-in-stata-and-python/) that walks through the Stata and Python code. The Jupyter notebook in this repo folder is a self-contained walk-through of a WLS regression. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
